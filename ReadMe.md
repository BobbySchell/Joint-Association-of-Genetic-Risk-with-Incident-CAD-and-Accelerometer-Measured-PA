Folder Structure in this repository and their role in the study replication
------------

1. Code Required - This folder contains all of the code used to process the data, perform all analyses, and produce figures in JupyterLab Notebooks.
2. Replications - This folder contains all of the results of studies we replicated. Most importantly, we validate the polygenic risk score and physical activity exposures.
3. Storage - This is a folder being used to store documents off of my hard drive temporarily.
