## Results for Polygenic Risk Score in Our Study: <br />
OR = 1.67 (95% CI: 1.65 to 1.70) <br />
N = 337,005 <br />

## Results for Polygenic Risk Score in Tamlander: <br />
OR = 1.72 (95% CI: 1.70 to 1.75) <br />
N = 343,672 <br />

Controlling for age and sex, we produced a similar association between incident and prevalent CAD and the standardized polygenic score compared to Tamlander, *et al.* The differences appear likely to be attributable to the difference in the population selected.
