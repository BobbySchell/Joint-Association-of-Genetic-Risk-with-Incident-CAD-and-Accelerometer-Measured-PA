## Descriptive Statistics by Sex and Tertile of PAEE

These tables are the means stratified by biological sex and PAEE tertile in this analysis as a replication of the analysis conducted in Dempsey *et al.'s* "Physical activity volume, intensity, and incident cardiovascular disease." All of the values fall within three points of the means in that analysis, which is indicative of a likely successful replication given the small differences in the samples chosen.
