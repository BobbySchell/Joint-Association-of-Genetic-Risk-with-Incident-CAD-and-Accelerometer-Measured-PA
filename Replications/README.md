This folder contains the results for replications of other studies we conducted. Specifically, we:

- Validated that the polygenic risk score performed as well as it should

- Validated the physical activity exposure variables (PAEE and Percent MVPA)

- Validated that a model specified with the covariates from Dempsey but with CAD instead of CVD as the outcome and a linear specification of the physical activity exposures produces results similar to those in Dempsey *et al.*
