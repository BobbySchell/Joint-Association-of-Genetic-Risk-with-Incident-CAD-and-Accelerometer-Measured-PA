Repository Contents
------------

This repository contains a detailed overview of the steps required to reproduce the analyses in "Joint Association of Genetic Risk and Accelerometer-Measured Physical Activity with Incident Coronary Artery Disease in the UK Biobank Cohort."

This document gives an overview of all data processing, sanity checks, and analyses performed for this manuscript. I created an accelerometer cohort, a phenotype cohort, and a polygenic risk score and merged them as the primary outputs of the document. The accelerometer cohort and phenotype cohort are distinct because I needed to keep the phenotype cohort intact to allow direct comparisons with the PRS scoreâ€™s performance in Tamlander et al., 2022 before merging them.

Dataset Availability
-----------

You must apply for the UK Biobank data through the Access Management System. This analysis was run using the UK Biobank's cloud-based Research Analysis Platform.
